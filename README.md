# Online-Banking
This python script allows users to view and transact using a bank GUI. Users are stored using an SQL database but loaded into a json file when logging in to a specific user. This was done to show understanding as well as to allow the json file to be stored locally if you had to use an SQL online database.
Once the user is done tranaction, the user information is saved back in the SQL database
